Current status:
* My qemu settings are fine
* I can boot shellx64.efi but not my kernel
* Or perhaps my kernel is trying to boot. I can't tell

* figure out where the qemu EFI files live
* build the rest of userspace and copy into image

v2
* no multi-tool binaries. replace busybox with sbase or rust core utils plus shell + init
* init can be busybox. i'll build it with one module only. the tiny inittab is too convenient
* shell can be dash
