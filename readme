Build everything in a container. Make it easy to build this OS from any distro without making a mess

Repo structure
* Directories named for the binaries they build
* Each contains
    * Source tarball
    * Dockerfile
    * Ideally nothing else



Kernel
* with all the needed disk drivers. I donâ€™t want an initramfs.
* Need to figure out what drivers I need
* Needs EFI Stub
* make tinyconfig

Init
* busybox init

Shell
* busybox getty
* busybox login

Filesystems
* busybox mount

Devices
* busybox mdev
* Not udevd
* /dev/console
* /dev/tty*
* DO THIS LAST
    * Focus on chroot and static builds first

Editor
* micro

Wayland
* Needs to be musl friendly
* sway, dwl, river

Terminal emulator
* kitty

Network
* busybox ip

Containers
* podman
* buildah
* youki (instead of runc)
    * rust
    * built static already

Browser
* wpewebkit + minibrowser

Files
* /etc/inittab
* /etc/fstab
* /etc/passwd
* /etc/group
* /etc/resolv.conf
* /etc/hosts



OUT OF SCOPE
* I can do these things from Arch
* mkext4
* efibootmgr
* fdisk
